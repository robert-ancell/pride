Pride is a console based IDE.

It was developed based on teaching Python to 9-10 year old students with [Raspberry Pis](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
I found the following issues:
 - We didn't have the space to store / setup multiple monitors, so remote access was desirable.
 - The students all had Chromebooks, which meant they had limited functionality.
 - Teaching shell as well as Python was a big hurdle to learning.
 - Existing editors are confusing to beginners with obscure key commands.

This project is an attempt to make a very simple IDE that can be accessed over SSH.

The name Pride is an acronym for Python Remote IDE.
